# Inputs for forcebalance optimization
File manifest:
    - optimize.in: input file that contains the optimization hyperparameters, and information about the targets to use in training, and the forcefield to optimize, regularization scales.
    - targets.tar.gz: compressed targets directory that contains optimized geometry targets (opt-geo-\*) and torsion profile targets (torsion-\*)
    - optimize.out: log file from forcebalance optimization run
    - \*.sh: slurm scripts to manage the job submission and worker jobs
    - 

P.S. torsion-35044997, and opt-geo-batch-170, generated by the create-fb-inputs file were excluded in fitting due to some failures with ELF10 charging (they crept up even after filtering out ELF10 errors)
